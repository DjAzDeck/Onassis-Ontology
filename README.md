## Onassis Ontology

**Figure 1:** The image presents a visualization of Onassis Ontology. Here, classes are represented as rectangles. Object Properties are portrayed as arrows with black tips. Subclass relationships are represented as arrows with white arrowheads. Datatype properties are presented within the rectangles of the classes. *Disjointedness* and *equivalence* between entities are illustrated via double-head arrows. The union of classes is represented through the corresponding Description Logic (DL) symbol. Different colors have been used to differentiate overlapping relationship (arrows) and external vocabulary terms (rectangles). Asterisks have been positioned next to properties with either the *Domain* and *Range* of *owl:Thing*, or the *Domain* of *owl:Thing* and range of a datatype value. Please note that the properties accompanied by an asterisks (i.e., the object property *isRelatedTo* and the datatype property *NaturalLanguageExpression*) are only placed as indications in relationships connecting a specific entity with another entity or datatype value (since they can de facto be used on all resources). Ultimately, the namespaces associated to the prefixes used in the ontology are presented in the bottom left rectangle.

**Figure 2:** Visualization of the use case scenario modeled with Onassis's ontological expressiveness. In the figure, individuals are represented as rectangles. Their associated datatype values are highlighted in blue. Relationships are represented as arrows.
